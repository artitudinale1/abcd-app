<b>ABC - JPC internal voting app

<b>BRIEF/BACKGOUND PROJECT</b>

I developed a Smartphone application for internal company use. 
Every month all employees nominate top performing colleagues who distinguished themselves for the hard work; a prize is assigned to the one with most votes. 
An end of year prize is given to the employee with the most votes in that year. 

<b>DESCRIPTION</b>

The app allows users to sign-in with their Twitter account and directly feature as a candidate to vote. A second interface makes it possible to vote for candidates listed and write their motivation. The app doesn't allow votes to occur twice in the same month and doesn't allow candidates to vote for themselves. 
An admin backdoor can be used to see the results, view the calculation of the results and who gained the most votes in that month and in the current year. 
The admin account can also see all Votes and motivations for the current month with the possibility to delete a candidate.
